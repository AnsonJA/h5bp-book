# Resources for HTML5 Boilerplate Web Development

HTML5 Boilerplate Web Development helps you understand the basics of writing effective websites using the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) framework. [You can buy HTML5 Boilerplate Web Development in Kindle or Dead-tree format](http://www.packtpub.com/html5-boilerplate-web-development/book). Any money I earn from this book goes to [Anti-Malaria Foundation](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF).

## Sun and Sand Music Festival

This is a hypothetic single-page music festival website that we work on to understand HTML5 Boilerplate. The website builds gradually over each chapter. You can download [all the files]() or download the files [chapter by chapter]().
